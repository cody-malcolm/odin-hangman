# Ruby Hangman

## Objective

As part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/file-i-o-and-serialization-ruby-programming)'s
curriculum, build a hangman application to practice file I/O and serialization.

## Requirements

1. When a new game is started, a dictionary should be loaded in using file I/O and a word randomly chosen
2. A count should be displayed to indicate the number of remaining incorrect guesses allowed
3. All previously chosen letters should be displayed, whether correct or incorrect
4. The game should be case insensitive
5. The player should have the ability to save the game each turn
6. The program should provide the option to load a saved game

## Runtime Example

## Author's Notes

### Preliminary Thoughts

Due to personal circumstances, I had to take a break for a couple of weeks. With the obvious exception of the file I/O aspects (which are relatively trivial), this seems to be a strictly simpler assignment than [Mastermind](https://github.com/cody-malcolm/odin-mastermind). As I put significant extra effort into that project, and I am eager to move on and get to the Rails curriculum, I don't intend to significantly overachieve for this project as it would be mostly redundant busywork.

### Final Thoughts


## Live Demo

<!-- The application is available for you to try out on [repl.it](https://replit.com/@CodyMalcolm/odin-hangman). -->
